# Nutri-Chat
Nutri-Chat is a mobile application that I developed for the needs of my Master's degree thesis. The thesis deals with the application of large language models (LLM) for understanding and generating dietary advice. The main problem involves identifying ingredients and nutritional values from food products and integrating this data into a system for providing useful recommendations. The problem was solved by developing a mobile application using React Native and Python Flask technologies. By implementing the docTR model for optical character recognition, it is possible to read the nutritional values and ingredients from the product image. Based on recognized ingredients and nutritional values and user data from the Firestore database, the system generates advice using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
